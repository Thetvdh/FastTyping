# Suggestions?

I am planning on potentially including a database to store scores from past sessions to compare scores.
Considering adding a mode where once the time elapses it auto continues to the next word rather than allowing you to continue.

If you have any suggestions send me a message on Twitter @Thetvdh1 or make a pull request with the suggestion if you want to have a crack at it yourself.

Currently there are not plans to make this a GUI based application as I cba to learn how to use Tkinter. If you want to create a GUI for it, go for it.
